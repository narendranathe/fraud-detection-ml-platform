# Real-Time Fraud Detection ML Platform

End-to-end ML platform for detecting fraudulent transactions using Apache Kafka, Spark Streaming, MLflow, and Airflow.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates production-grade ML engineering skills including:
- Real-time fraud detection with machine learning
- Streaming data pipeline with Kafka and Spark
- MLOps with MLflow for experiment tracking and model registry
- Orchestration with Apache Airflow
- Feature engineering with time-based aggregations
- Model monitoring and drift detection
